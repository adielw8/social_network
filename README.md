# Social Network

Objective of this task is to create a simple REST API based social network in Django,
and create a bot which will demonstrate functionalities of the system according to
defined rules.

Basic models:

- User
- Post (always made by a user)

Basic features:
- user signup
- user login
- post creation
- post like
- post unlike
For User and Post objects, candidate is free to define attributes as they see fit.

Requirements:

- use Hunter (https://hunter.io/) for verifying email existence on signup
- use Clearbit enrichment (https://clearbit.com/enrichment) for getting
    additional data for the user on signup
- use JWT for user authentication
- use Django with any other apps, databases etc.

## Automated bot

Automated bot should demonstrate how the API is used. The bot should read rules
from a config file (in any format chosen by the candidate), but should have following
fields (all integers, candidate can rename as they see fit):

- number_of_users
- max_posts_per_user
- max_likes_per_user
Bot should read the configuration and create this activity:
- signup users (number provided in config)
- each user creates random number of posts with any content (up to
max_posts_per_user)
After creating the signup and posting activity, posts should be liked using following
rules:


- next user to perform a like is the user who has most posts and has not
    reached max likes
- user performs “like” activity until he reaches max likes
- user can only like random posts from users who have at least one post with 0
    likes
- if there is no posts with 0 likes, bot stops
- users cannot like their own posts
- posts can be liked multiple times, but one user can like a certain post only
    once

## Notes

- Hunter and Clearbit have either free pricing plans or free trial, the candidate
    can use their own account
- visual aspect of the project is not important, the candidate can create a
    frontend for viewing the result, but it is not necessary. Clean and usable REST
    API is important
- the project is not defined in detail, the candidate should use their best
    judgment for every non-specified requirements (including chosen tech, third
    party apps, etc), however every decision must be explained and backed by
    arguments in the interview — esoteric/different choices explained in a
    readme are preferable and will allow for a better review of the assignment.
- **Result should be sent by providing a Git url. This is a mandatory**
    **requirement.**
